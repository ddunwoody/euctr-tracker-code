helen: One thought I had was perhaps it's useful to put your description of
major sponsors (and maybe "click here to see all sponsors"?) directly
underneath  the header "How many trials have major sponsors reported?" - of
course too much text would be unhelpful because people won't read it, but one
line is probably OK here?

helen: a minor point on the blurb at the top, it says "universities and pharmaceutical companies" but there are other organisations like NHS / hospital trusts, was this deliberately simplified or should other types of organisation be mentioned?  (looks like there's at least 3 or 4 of these in the major sponsors list)

Load data for each organisation into separate SQL row or JSON file (by first letter? by trial id hash?)
Make a page for each individual organisation
Add list of individual trials, with their titles, to the organisation pages

Pfizer count wrong - 154 / 161 vs 154 / 160
Make sure Nick can use SQL

Add .table-responsive
    http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables

Remove table4 JSON

graphic generated for each centre:
- the distribution of reporting rates, and a line for where they sit in that  
- proportion reported from each year, by completion date
- something new we haven't thought of yet. 

Very basic tests
Test on IE11 and Edge 
Make it cache it for scaling
Disable sessions, remove migrations and SQLite database for now at least

Add social sharing stuff
Twitter / Facebook sharing links on pages - look up best practice
