Daily update
  Check the cron runs
    Make it report via New Relic or Mailgun
  Consider what happens when it runs half way through a partial scrape
  Consider making it not write other files if new_trials.csv has stuff in?
  Notify Nick if there are entrie sin the new_trials.csv
  Notification if updates stop happening
  Don't update got_from_db in trials.csv.json if nothing changed
  Get on tech@ebmdatalab.net - ask Seb
  Change cron email to tech@ebmdatalab.net
Important update is monthly after site is live (otherwise don't worry)

Run tests    
"We think Actavis is now effectively part of Aurobindo. Teva. Allergan." should have commas
Add proportion of all trials that have inconsistent data to headline and headline-history

Test on IE11 and Edge 
  - search box on IE11
  - BrowserStack account
Test both pages without Javascript - do any links need to work or should be hidden?

Check with Ben
  Mobile, worth polishing more or not
  When zooming for presentation, not enough shows in table (Ben)

  LATE REPORTING on companies page --> NOT REPORTED (Helen)
    do we think LATE REPORTING is the most obvious headline on the companies pages?
    they are basically NOT REPORTED, right? we don't include trials which have been
    reported but were done so late (outside of the 12 mo timescale)
  When you toggle to ALL SPONSORS on the home page it jumps up to the top of the page
  Clarify the difference between *publishing* a trial and *reporting results*
      in the register in the FAQs, in particular this bit:  (Helen)
      >Non-publication of clinical trial results is an ongoing global public health problem.
      >By EU law, from December 2016, all trials on the European Union Clinical Trials Register (EUCTR) must post results within 12 months of completion. This is the first legislation enacted anywhere in the world which requires such trial publication.

Social sharing stuff
  Screenshot image too slow to make for Twitter? https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
  Slow sometimes for Facebook
    Provided og:image, https://eutrialstracker.ebmdatalab.net/screenshot-0002.png
    could not be downloaded because it exceeded the maximum allowed sized of 8Mb or
    your server was too slow to respond.
  Include size
    <meta name="twitter:image:width" content= "..." />
    <meta name="twitter:image:height" content= "..." />

  Add social sharing buttons (talk to Ben)
    The chart. - sharing the chart.
    (what is the ratio of the image on twitter/ tweetdeck, so making sure it
    looks good there, and doesnâ€™t get truncated)

Error monitoring
  Back-end errors, zero tolerance
  Errorception - dropped
  "New Relic"
Change chown to root:www-data - ghostdriver.log a problem and pycache
For scaling, do we need to cache front page or other pages

Launch
  Link to "Methods" in navigation, going to the paper on BMJ or similar site

*** Visulisation improvement - two figures to highlight
  Try 
    - pie chart
    - histogram on the right three stacked bars:
      1) late/reported split (red/green same as pie), 2) not due, 3) inconsistent data
      still headline the inconsistent data part

OpenTrials questions
  - make sure update schedule of scraper is weekly, and confirm day ends
    started 2017-05-05 ended 2017-05-07
    started 2017-05-17 ended 2017-05-19
    ??? may have been another here, but don't think so
    started 2017-06-06 ended 2017-06-08

  Why are there old trials that haven't updated? (their meta_updated)

Later
=====

Use new filename for screenshots as the numbers change

Maybe make orange arrow thicker again to match font (Ayesha prefers)
Column widths flicker if you scroll down and up again. https://github.com/DataTables/FixedHeader/issues/94

Display history
  Do this a few months, or a year in 
  Proportion of due trials that are late
  Proportion of all trials that have inconsistent data

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)

Details on: also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can
we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)
