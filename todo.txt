    Provided og:image, https://eutrialstracker.ebmdatalab.net/screenshot-0002.png
    could not be downloaded because it exceeded the maximum allowed sized of 8Mb or

Test on IE11 and Edge 
  - search box on IE11
  - BrowserStack account
Test both pages without Javascript - do any links need to work or should be hidden?
For scaling, do we need to cache front page or other pages

Error monitoring
  Back-end errors, zero tolerance
  Errorception - dropped
  "New Relic"
Change chown to root:www-data - ghostdriver.log a problem and pycache

Column widths flicker if you scroll down and up again. https://github.com/DataTables/FixedHeader/issues/94

  Link to "Methods" in navigation, going to the paper on BMJ or similar site

*** Visulisation improvement - two figures to highlight
  Try 
    - pie chart
    - histogram on the right three stacked bars:
      1) late/reported split (red/green same as pie), 2) not due, 3) inconsistent data
      still headline the inconsistent data part

OpenTrials questions
  - make sure update schedule of scraper is weekly, and confirm day ends
    started 2017-05-05 ended 2017-05-07
    started 2017-05-17 ended 2017-05-19
    ??? may have been another here, but don't think so
    started 2017-06-06 ended 2017-06-08

=====

Display history
  Do this a few months, or a year in 
  Proportion of due trials that are late
  Proportion of all trials that have inconsistent data

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)

Details on: also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can
we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)
