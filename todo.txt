*** Scraping 
  - dynamically change max_end_date threshold 
      max_end_date <= '2015-12-21' 
    to 1 year and 3 weeks before the beginning of the scrape
  - put that dynamic date in headlines.json
  - "check the registration dates are largely since jan 2017"
  - remove data files from then on in pipeline from github
  - set environment variables for database connection in production
    see https://github.com/ebmdatalab/openprescribing#production-notes
  - make sure update schedule of scraper is weekly
  - log changes to overall figures every week
  - why are there old trials that haven't updated? (their meta_updated)

*** Present normalisation of sponsor name better
  e.g. Tigenix, Abbie
  e.g. Genentech, Actavis (Teva, Aurobindo), Pfizer, Merck (relationships both ways) 
  - don't render trials if there aren't any http://127.0.0.1:8000/sponsor/tigenix
  - consider having a heading in new bottom position
  - get tidying from Nick for similar names that don't occur often

Looks weird when all reported

Social sharing stuff
  Screenshot image too slow to make for Twitter? https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
  Slow sometimes for Facebook
    Provided og:image, https://eutrialstracker.ebmdatalab.net/screenshot-0002.png
    could not be downloaded because it exceeded the maximum allowed sized of 8Mb or
    your server was too slow to respond.
  Include size
    <meta name="twitter:image:width" content= "..." />
    <meta name="twitter:image:height" content= "..." />

*** Visulisation improvement - two figures to highlight
  Try 
    - pie chart
    - bar chart for bad data

  X% of this sponsor's trials are overdue.

  X of their trials have bad data. [For the purposes of the site, we don't
  care if those ones have shared results, that's for the detail of the
  paper].

  The only challenge really is that those two figures have a different
  denominator (due trials, and all trials, respectively).

  Try making the table have charts in


Test on IE11 and Edge 
  - search box on IE11
Test both pages without Javascript - do any links need to work or should be hidden?
For scaling, do we need to cache front page or other pages

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)

Details on: also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can
we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)
