Crawl:
  base/config.py - sort out test and CI modes at top
  base/* - check all needed
  Move alembic migrations over
  Error logging to a log file
  Check that retry works now when there is a 404 
  - tweak params so it retries in sensible pattern
  Consider using https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/jobs.html for re-entrancy

  When import from db to JSON happens, make sure DOESN'T write files if any trials missing from normalisation
  - it should notify Nick but that is all

  Watch for new scrapes no updating old data - why do some trials get missed in crawl next time?

Put error handling back
  new_trials.drop(normalize['trial_id'], inplace=True, errors="ignore") # TODO: put errosr back

Work out spec for social sharing buttons (talk to Ben)
  "Tell everyone" as CTA title with Twitter | Facebook buttons
   Just include not reported trials

OpenTrials questions
  Why are there old trials that haven't updated? (their meta_updated)
    https://github.com/opentrials/opentrials/issues/821

Use new filename for screenshots as the numbers change

Column widths flicker if you scroll down and up again. https://github.com/DataTables/FixedHeader/issues/94

Display history
  Do this a few months, or a year in 
  Proportion of due trials that are late
  Proportion of all trials that have inconsistent data

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)

Details on: also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can
we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)
