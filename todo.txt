*** Clean story to people new to the issue - details elsewhere

Ask Nick or Ben
    /ab-science isn't in all_sponsors - isn't listed as has no due trials. Should it be?
    Front page has "% Reported", but sponsor page has "% Unreported" - keep consistent?
    Someone needs to check the figures
Ask Lisa
  Sort by status should not be alphabetic (Lisa) - ask if OK now have filter
Ask Helen
  Details on: also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can
  we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)

On the data table layout, the arrows for sorting by column don't make visual
sense in the "sponsor" column as the text is left aligned and the arrows right
aligned. Perhaps left align the arrows. (Seb)

"Some have, some have not" not true if they are all one way
Not obvious that it is paginated when you get to the bottom (Ben)
Column widths flicker if you scroll down and up again. https://github.com/DataTables/FixedHeader/issues/94

Test on IE11 and Edge 
For scaling, do we need to cache front page or other pages
Disable sessions, remove migrations and SQLite database for now at least
Install Lets Encrypt

Test both pages without Javascript - do any links need to work or should be hidden?

Add social sharing stuff - with an image of the chart
Twitter / Facebook sharing links on pages - look up best practice
Consider adding meta descriptions, e.g. for sponsor pages
