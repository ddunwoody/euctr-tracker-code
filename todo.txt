OpenTrials questions
  Why are there old trials that haven't updated? (their meta_updated)
    https://github.com/opentrials/opentrials/issues/821

Use new filename for screenshots as the numbers change

Column widths flicker if you scroll down and up again. https://github.com/DataTables/FixedHeader/issues/94

Display history
  Do this a few months, or a year in 
  Proportion of due trials that are late
  Proportion of all trials that have inconsistent data

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)
