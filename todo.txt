  Make sure they die!
Maybe use headless chrome instead

Check correspondence between processes and gunicorn instances


Crawl:
  OpenTrials migration tidying
    base/config.py - sort out test and CI modes at top
    base/* - check all needed
    Move alembic migrations over
    euctr_set_meta_updated trigger and set_meta_updated function - make sure never get lost again

  Rotate / prune log files

  Document crawl deployment in README

  Check all history in "Tracker Background Data" is stored in a way can get it, even if in git history
    Is OK to keep using deleted trials in data sets, because kept in database
    Take care that database will be reused and updated


Missing trials
  Put error handling back
    new_trials.drop(normalize['trial_id'], inplace=True, errors="ignore") # TODO: put errosr back

  These trials are missing now, in normalize spreadsheet

New tracking
  Keep track of "deleted / removed from site", i.e. old trials not updated
  Keep track of "reported late", that a trial reported too late


Work out spec for social sharing buttons (talk to Ben)
  "Tell everyone" as CTA title with Twitter | Facebook buttons
   Just include not reported trials


Launch
  Link to "Methods" in navigation, going to the paper on BMJ or similar site

  Test before live on
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/sponsor/bayer
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/sponsor/leiden-university
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/sponsor/university-of-groningen


After launch
  Twitter cards need testing https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator

  Important to check update is monthly after site is live (otherwise don't worry)

  Tell Nick when there are new updates
  Notification if updates stop happening
    Make it report via New Relic or Mailgun
    Change cron email to tech@ebmdatalab.net

OpenTrials questions
  Why are there old trials that haven't updated? (their meta_updated)
    https://github.com/opentrials/opentrials/issues/821

Use new filename for screenshots as the numbers change

Column widths flicker if you scroll down and up again. https://github.com/DataTables/FixedHeader/issues/94

Display history
  Do this a few months, or a year in 
  Proportion of due trials that are late
  Proportion of all trials that have inconsistent data

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)

Details on: also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can
we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)
