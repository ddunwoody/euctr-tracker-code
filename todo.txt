Add list of individual trials, with their titles, to the sponsor pages

Change sponsor page to have:
            - title
            - link to search result for that ID on EUCTR (in order to work around EUCTR
            not having a page for each trial...)
            - "Completion date" (=max end date)
            - status: "ongoing" / "completed, not yet due" / "overdue and unreported" /
            "reported" / "inconsistent registry data" (i'll try to think of catchier
            briefer descriptions...)

            we could colour code status. grey ongoing, amber completed, red overdue,
            green reported, ?purple error

            "inconsistent registry data" means:
            - it has at least one completion date but some sites are marked as ongoing <-- check logic
            - all sites are marked complete but there is no completion date
            Use the all_complete_no_comp_date,comp_date_while_ongoing fields

            shall i ask nick to simply generate that as a variable, saves you computing?


"I find the changing column widths when switching between "all" and "major"
a bit disconcerting. If it was easy enough to fix that would be nice." - seb

Link to EUCTR sponsor and trial pages
Make row red where the results aren't reported

Pfizer count wrong - 154 / 161 vs 154 / 160
Make sure Nick can use SQL

graphic generated for each centre:
- the distribution of reporting rates, and a line for where they sit in that  
- proportion reported from each year, by completion date
- something new we haven't thought of yet. 

Wording when there is only 1 trial etc. on sponsor page is a bit off

Undo this rename?
            'normalized_name': 'sponsor_name',
            'has_results': 'total_reported',
            'results_expected': 'total_due'

Save search state in URLs

Sort the JSON for all_sponsors to speed up initial load?
Test on IE11 and Edge 
Make it cache front page for scaling
Disable sessions, remove migrations and SQLite database for now at least
Install Lets Encrypt
Make major sponsors link work without Javascript

Add social sharing stuff
Twitter / Facebook sharing links on pages - look up best practice
Consider adding meta descriptions, e.g. for sponsor pages
