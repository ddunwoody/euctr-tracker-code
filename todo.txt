Two figures to highlight
  X% of this sponsor's trials are overdue.

  X of their trials have bad data. [For the purposes of the site, we don't
  care if those ones have shared results, that's for the detail of the
  paper].

  The only challenge really is that those two figures have a different
  denominator (due trials, and all trials, respectively).
