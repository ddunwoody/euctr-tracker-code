Notes from paper reading:
  "All data for EUCTR was therefore updated on 18th January 2017 to ensure that
  the data was current and reflected compliance with the legislation."

  "This ongoing ranking from updated current data will be made available at
  EU-trialstracker.ebmdatalab.net"

*** Visulisation improvement - two figures to highlight
  Try 
    - pie chart
    - bar chart for bad data

  X% of this sponsor's trials are overdue.

  X of their trials have bad data. [For the purposes of the site, we don't
  care if those ones have shared results, that's for the detail of the
  paper].

  The only challenge really is that those two figures have a different
  denominator (due trials, and all trials, respectively).

  Try making the table have charts in
