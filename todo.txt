*** Scraping 
  - what's update schedule?
  - where run now?
  - meant to be live and different from paper
  - be able to do changes over time for overall numbers - LOG every week
  - need weekly update

*** Present normalisation of sponsor name better
  - Genentech
  - Actavis (Teva, Aurobindo)
  - When loading data "Failed to find parent tigenix for child tigenix-sau0" etc.
Later:
  - for Schering Plough ---> Merck put "this includes trials conducted by [acquired company]"
  - can show evidence for assertion too (in Nick's spreadsheet)

*** Visulisation improvement - two figures to highlight
  Try 
    - pie chart
    - bar chart for bad data

  X% of this sponsor's trials are overdue.

  X of their trials have bad data. [For the purposes of the site, we don't
  care if those ones have shared results, that's for the detail of the
  paper].

  The only challenge really is that those two figures have a different
  denominator (due trials, and all trials, respectively).

  Try making the table have charts in
