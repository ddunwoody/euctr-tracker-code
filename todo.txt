Sponsor page
    Should we offer filters of inconsistent / overdue trials? To make it easy to find them.
    Someone needs to check the figures

What should sort by status do? (F asks)
Ben
    Key on page - hovering doesn't work
    Footnotes?
    Not so clear there are two pages
    
    Clean story to people new to the issue - details elsewhere
    Make sure very clear can switch between trials - big tabs

    Inconsistent - show full reason (Lisa)
    Sort by status should not be alphabetic (Lisa)
    Completed - assumed it meant "done + reported" not completed less than a year ago (Lisa)
    Summary at top with total trials in register, due, late unreported etc. in a table (Helen)

/ab-science isn't in all_sponsors - isn't listed as has no due trials. Should it be?
    
Main page - put low % places at top of list more interesting (Helen)
Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)
also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)

on design, the "out of N results...breaking the law" fonts are mixed (due to
part of it being `<h2>`). I think it all needs to be the serif font. (Seb)

On the data table layout, the arrows for sorting by column don't make visual
sense in the "sponsor" column as the text is left aligned and the arrows right
aligned. Perhaps left align the arrows. (Seb)

Column widths flicker if you scroll down and up again. https://github.com/DataTables/FixedHeader/issues/94
 
Pfizer count wrong - 154 / 161 vs 154 / 160

graphic generated for each centre:
- the distribution of reporting rates, and a line for where they sit in that  
  Line graph of cumulative proportion reported with line where they are
- proportion reported from each year, by completion date NUMBERS LOW
- something new we haven't thought of yet. 

Test on IE11 and Edge 
For scaling, do we need to cache front page or other pages
Disable sessions, remove migrations and SQLite database for now at least
Install Lets Encrypt

Save search state in URLs? Back button does reload the table losing place
Make major sponsors link work without Javascript

Add social sharing stuff
Twitter / Facebook sharing links on pages - look up best practice
Consider adding meta descriptions, e.g. for sponsor pages
