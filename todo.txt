*** Scraping 
  - dynamically change max_end_date threshold 
      max_end_date <= '2015-12-21' 
    to 1 year and 3 weeks before the beginning of the scrape
  - put that dynamic date in headlines.json, remove DATA_SOURCE_DATE setting
  - make copy on /about imply that date is a couple of days long

  - load in, where mapping missing use slug match, otherwise it is just a new sponsor
  - write out sheet of new trials which uses those new matchings
  - email (?) that sheet to Nick

  - log changes to overall figures every week
  - remove data files from then on in pipeline from github

  - make sure update schedule of scraper is weekly
  - why are there old trials that haven't updated? (their meta_updated)

  - "check the registration dates are largely since jan 2017"

Some trials aren't updating with new scrapes

*** Visulisation improvement - two figures to highlight
  Try 
    - pie chart
    - bar chart for bad data

  X% of this sponsor's trials are overdue.

  X of their trials have bad data. [For the purposes of the site, we don't
  care if those ones have shared results, that's for the detail of the
  paper].

  The only challenge really is that those two figures have a different
  denominator (due trials, and all trials, respectively).

  Try making the table have charts in


Test on IE11 and Edge 
  - search box on IE11
Test both pages without Javascript - do any links need to work or should be hidden?
For scaling, do we need to cache front page or other pages

Main page - make numbers in columns link straight to filtered versions of sponsor pages (Seb)

Details on: also it's not easy to see HOW late the overdue trials are.. can
we say X trials are late, on average/maximum/minimum xx days/months? (Helen)
