    <h1>About the EU Trials Tracker</h1>
	</div>

	<p class="lead">Non-publication of clinical trial results is an 
		<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/make-journals-report-clinical-trials-properly-1.19280">ongoing global public health problem</a>.
	</p>

	<p>By EU law, from December 2016, all trials on the 
	<a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu">European Union Clinical
	Trials Register</a> (EUCTR) must post results within 12 months of completion.
	This is the first legislation enacted anywhere in the world which requires
	such trial publication.
	</p>

	<p>EU Trials Tracker shows which organisations are compliant and which 
	aren't.

	<p>You can find it at XXX

	<h2 id="which-trials">Which trials are in the register?</h2>

	<p>Roughly, all clinical trials conducted in Europe since 2004 are in the
	register. For full details, see the register's
	<a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/about.html">about page</a>.
	</p>

	<h2 id="when-updated">When was the data updated?</h2>

	<p>The current data was taken from the register on {{ data_source_date | date:"d M Y"}}.
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="major-sponsor">What's a major sponsor?</h2>

	<p>The table on the <a href="/">front page</a> can show only sponsors
	with 50 or more trials in the register.
	</p>

	<h2 id="bad-data">What does "bad data" mean for a trial?</h2>

	<p>Some trials have problematic data on the registry. There
	are three reasons for this:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		All the sites are listed as completed, so there should be a
		completion date; and yet there is no completion date for the trial. 
		</li>
		<li>
		There is a date for the “global end of the trial”; and yet some of
		the sites are still listed as ongoing. 
		</li>
		<li>
		For some, the trial status is left entirely blank. 
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>These errors may be due to trialists’ errors, or failures at the
	registry. However, we think the EU registry managers could and should
	automatically identify trials with inconsistent data, as we have done; and
	then require trialists to correct their records. More details are in our
	paper.
