    <h1>About the EU Trials Tracker</h1>
	</div>

	<h2>What's this about?</h2>

	<p>Non-publication of clinical trial results is an 
		<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/make-journals-report-clinical-trials-properly-1.19280">ongoing global public health problem</a>.
	</p>

	<p>By EU law, from December 2016, all trials on the 
	<a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu">European Union Clinical
	Trials Register</a> (EUCTR) must post results within 12 months of completion.
	This is the first legislation enacted anywhere in the world which requires
	such trial publication.
	</p>

	<p>EU Trials Tracker shows which organisations are compliant and which 
	aren't.
	</p>

	<h2>Where can I read the journal paper about this?</h2>

	<p>You can find it at XXX
	</p>

	<h2>Which trials are in the register?</h2>

	<p>Roughly, all clinical trials conducted in Europe since 2004 are in the
	register. For full details, see the register's
	<a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/about.html">about page</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>When was the data updated?</h2>

	<p>The current data was taken from the register on {{ data_source_date | date:"d M Y"}}.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What's a major sponsor?</h2>

	<p>The table on the <a href="/">front page</a> shows only sponsors 
	with 50 or more trials in the register.
